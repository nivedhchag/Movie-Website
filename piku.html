              <p class="card-text">Piku is a 2015 comedy film about the relationship between an architect named Piku (Deepika Padukone) and her aging father, Bhashkor (Amitabh Bachchan): 
                Plot
                Piku lives in Delhi with her father, who is obsessed with his health and bowel movements. Piku loves her father but gets irritated by his eccentricities, such as firing the housemaid for stealing Phenyl, even though she objects. Piku's life is often disrupted by her father's health issues, such as when she has to cut short work meetings and dates to deal with his constipation. 
                Themes
                The film explores how some people become so important in our lives that we care for them despite their flaws. It also highlights the importance of honoring one's parents. 
                Reviews
                Some say the film is emotionally rich and satisfying, with a quirky and endearing family. Others say the film showcases an eccentric father-daughter relationship without being preachy or over-the-top.
